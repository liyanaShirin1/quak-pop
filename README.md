# QUAK-POP üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Liyana Shirin A A


### Project Description
Quak Pop is a wonderfully useless bubble wrap simulator where you pop bubbles just to find a duck that says 'quak'. That‚Äôs it. No points, no levels ‚Äî just pure, pointless joy. Because why not?
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People don‚Äôt get enough closure from popping real bubble wrap because the bubbles never talk back. It‚Äôs 2025 ‚Äî we deserve better.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A duck that says ‚Äúquak‚Äù when you find it. Emotional validation, but in bubble form.

When you start the game you pop and pop and pop at one point it will pop and a duck will appear and its goes yuck which is funny and surprising
